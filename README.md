# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of the school district analysis: 

## Purpose of this analysis:

According to the specifications of the project, the previous school analysis needs to be re-run due to suspected cheating on the 9th grade tests of Thomas High School. The school board has sought out the help of Maria and her supervisor to address the suspected academic dishonesty on the state-testing. Maria has asked us to replace the 9th grade Thomas High School scores with NaNs. After the compromised data has been replaced, we were asked to re-run the school analysis and give a report the results.
